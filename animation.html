        <p><font size = "4">    I created several vector images in Adobe Animate, including the background, house, cloud, arrows, and hail. As my first layer, I created the background and chose a darker blue that I felt might represent the sky during a storm. As part of this layer, I also created a simple house. I chose orange and blue as the colors for the house to represent the University of Florida. I also created a large cloud for this layer, choosing a dark gray to represent a storm cloud. For the second layer, I created and animated the arrows to demonstrate airflow in a storm and made them yellow so that they would stand out against the darker background. As another layer, I added my name and decided to make it yellow in order to match the arrows. With the next layer, I added the text in the cloud to label air in the cloud that is below and above freezing. For the final layer, I created and animated hail to show various sized pieces of hail falling from the cloud. To finish my animation video, I added the background sound of a thunderstorm from mixkit.co, narration, and a fade transition. There was a lot of trial and error and video watching when creating my animation video. I have learned so much about animation through this assignment and realize that I could spend days adding and adjusting images and animations.
