I use this software in my current role to create assessment items and build assessments using those items. I decided to create a multiple-choice item because it is one the most straightforward items to create, making it more manageable for the length of my Screencast.</font><br> </p>

       <font size = "4">I enjoyed using Camtasia to create my Screencast and think that it is a great tool. Using Camtasia, I recorded my screen and voiceover and added animations to the beginning and end of my video. I also added text as an introduction and conclusion, using blue and orange to match some of the colors in my screen recording. I decided to change the color and add a shadow to my cursor to make it easier to follow during the screen recording. Initially, I had my cursor highlighted but found that the highlight was covering some of my text, so I decided to change it. Finally, I added yellow arrows to signal key areas on the screen as I was demonstrating. I tried a few different colors for the cursor and arrows but decided to keep yellow because I found it more eye-catching.  </font>
