                <p><font size = "4">I am still exploring quantitative research methods, and my current focus is on the fundamentals of probability theory in data science. As for the question bank, I revised it to include 10 questions on probability theory. Below is the process I followed to enhance the aesthetics of the webpage:

  - I revised the quiz title and added a new subtitle. And the title and subtitle were styled with a yellow font to ensure they stand out.
  - The <body> background was replaced with an image to create a more engaging visual experience.
  - The question box, solution box, and response dropdown were given extra padding and green borders for better visual clarity.
  - The table was updated with a white, semi-transparent background, rounded corners, and a drop shadow to provide a clean look.
  - Buttons like Back and Next were also redesigned with rounded corners and a soft blue background for improved contrast.

Each time I made changes, I refreshed the webpage  to check and verify. My file structure and code logic were modified based on the template provided by Dr. L.</font> </p> <br>

                 <br> <br><br> <br> <p><font size = "4">My topic remains probability theory. First, I revised 12 keywords and categorized them into 4 groups. To enhance the website's visual appeal, I made the following optimizations to the template's CSS:

Changed the background color of the page to light green.
Updated the h1 headings to blue.
Increased the border thickness of the main container and set it to blue. #dhtmlgoodies_dragDropContainer
Set the background color of the main container to light blue.
Added a hover effect to make the container more noticeable, including changing its background to light green and border to blue.  #dhtmlgoodies_dragDropContainer .mouseover
Modified the sidebar titles to have a warm yellow background and black text. #dhtmlgoodies_listOfItems and #dhtmlgoodies_mainContainer </font></p>
